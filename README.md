# Predicting Rookie WR Yards With Linear Regression

This code scrapes NFL, college, draft, and combine data to fit a linear regression model on rookie wide receiver yards in the NFL. 

## Outline of Files

In order to re-produce the results of this linear regression model, clone this repository and run the code in the following order:

**1. preprocessing.py**: 



**2. train_regression.py**: 

**3. plots.py:**

The python code above utilizes the following modules created for this project:

**scrape_nfl.py**: 

Contains five functions used to scrape 
data from [pro-football-reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)  and [https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/), as well as two two functions used for cleaning the same data.
